# Things that need doing

1. [x] Update dependencies:
   - [x] Review the `requirements.txt` file and update the dependencies to their latest compatible versions as of 2024.
   - [x] Ensure that the updated dependencies are still compatible with the project's codebase.

2. [x] Refactor codebase:
   - [x] Review the codebase and identify any deprecated or outdated practices.
   - [x] Refactor the code to follow the latest Python best practices and coding standards as of 2024.
   - [x] Improve code organization, modularity, and readability.
   - [ ] Add type hints to function signatures for better static type checking.

3. [ ] Error handling and logging:
   - [ ] Implement robust error handling throughout the codebase.
   - [ ] Use appropriate exception classes for specific error scenarios.
   - [ ] Ensure that exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
   - [ ] Implement logging to capture important events, errors, and debug information.

4. [ ] Testing and documentation:
   - [ ] Write unit tests for critical components of the project.
   - [ ] Aim for good test coverage to ensure code reliability.
   - [ ] Update the project's documentation, including README.md and API documentation.
   - [ ] Provide clear instructions on how to set up, configure, and use the project.

5. [ ] Implement the command line script:
   - [ ] Create a new Python script, e.g., `weatherlink_cli.py`, that serves as the entry point for the command line interface.
   - [ ] Use a popular command line argument parsing library like `argparse` or `click` to define and handle command line arguments.
   - [ ] Implement the following functionality in the script:
     - [ ] Accept command line arguments for specifying the weather station's host and port.
     - [ ] Retrieve the current weather conditions from the specified weather station using the `get_current_condition` function.
     - [ ] Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the retrieval process.
     - [ ] Format the retrieved weather data as JSON.
     - [ ] Print the JSON output to the console.

6. [ ] Packaging and distribution:
   - [ ] Update the project's setup configuration file (`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`) with the latest metadata and dependencies.
   - [ ] Consider using a modern packaging tool like `poetry` or `flit` for simplified dependency management and building.
   - [ ] Build and package the project as a distributable Python package.
   - [ ] Publish the package to the Python Package Index (PyPI) or a private package repository if desired.

7. [ ] Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
   - [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a platform like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
   - [ ] Configure the pipeline to automatically run tests, lint the codebase, and build the package on each push or pull request.
   - [ ] Set up automatic deployment to PyPI or a package repository upon successful builds on the main branch.

8. [ ] Security and performance:
   - [ ] Review the codebase for any potential security vulnerabilities and address them.
   - [ ] Optimize critical parts of the code for better performance, if necessary.
   - [ ] Consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve response times, if applicable.

9. [ ] Documentation and examples:
   - [ ] Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use the command line script.
   - [ ] Include examples of common usage scenarios and command line arguments.
   - [ ] Update the project's README.md to reflect the new command line functionality and provide instructions for installation and usage.

10. [ ] Maintenance and support:
    - [ ] Set up an issue tracker or a support channel for users to report bugs, ask questions, and provide feedback.
    - [ ] Regularly monitor and address issues and pull requests.
    - [ ] Keep the project's dependencies up to date and address any security vulnerabilities promptly.
